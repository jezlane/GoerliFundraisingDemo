# GoerliFundraisingDemo

This is a DApp Demo application that I wrote, primarily I wanted to investigate the following technologies

- Vite for development
- Vitest for testing
- useDApp for Web3 integration
- Goerli Testnet

This is a semi-complete app, I aim to complete with the following:

- Build out test scripts
- Build out backend for registration storage
- Expand React Hooks to mask more web3 functionality

Thanks for checking it out :)
